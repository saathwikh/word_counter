The old lighthouse stood guard on the rocky cliff, its weathered surface etched with stories of countless storms. Salty spray kissed the cracked windows, and the wind sang a lonely tune through the rusting iron railings. Inside, a dusty logbook lay open, its pages filled with faded entries recording the passage of ships and the ever-changing moods of the sea. Though no longer manned, the lighthouse remained a silent sentinel, a beacon of hope for weary travelers on the vast, churning ocean.
